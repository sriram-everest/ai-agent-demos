# Browser automation using browser-use agent sdk

Using Browser Use (https://browser-use.com/) to do browser automation.

There are two examples - one is using OpenAI , which requires you to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in the root of the project.

The other example is using Ollama (model `qwen2.5:7b`). NOTE: the model downloaded has to support tools/function calling - https://ollama.com/search?c=tools.
